"""
Match-Case Statements:
    Introduced in Python 3.10 + 
    Similar to Switch Case which we use in C, C++ or Java except we dont need to specify break, Python checks for case
    A match statement will compare a given variableâ€™s value to different shapes, also referred to as the pattern. 
    The main idea is to keep on comparing the variable with all the present patterns until it fits into one.
    The match case consists of three main entities :
        The match keyword
        One or more case clauses
        Expression for each case
        Default Case : Underscore _
    The case clause consists of a pattern to be matched to the variable, a condition to be evaluated if the pattern matches, and a set of statements to be executed if the pattern matches.
