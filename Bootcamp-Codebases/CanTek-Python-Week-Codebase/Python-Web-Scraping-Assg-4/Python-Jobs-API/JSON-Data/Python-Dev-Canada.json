Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.\n\nAbout Our Client\n\nOur Client's Vision\n\nAt our client, they believe the next iteration of the internet will be delivered to XR devices. It represents a fundamental and pivotal change on how we work, socialize and learn today. To power the next generation of the internet and drive mainstream adoption, we need to meet or surpass the scale and quality of service we have in today’s internet. In order to achieve this, a new infrastructure and technology stack needs to be built and integrated. To make this a reality we are building their product. We also believe this... new infrastructure should be a public good.\n\nWhat we are building\n\nThe Network is a decentralized 3D & XR content delivery platform that breaks the bottlenecks of infrastructure supply for real-time rendering, and the lack of local compute power on XR Devices. We do this by orchestrating a decentralized network of GPU-powered nodes that run the Engine, a proprietary technology stack that allows to render interactive 3D content and stream it efficiently in real-time to mobile XR devices at scale. We believe Web3 principles in conjunction with our core technology will accelerate the scalability of the Network.\n\nWhy work with us\n\nOur client is a pioneer in Cloud Rendering and Streaming technologies. Our core technology has been validated in the market through repeated success in the XR industry with over 40+ deployments to date worldwide. We have strong world-class partnerships with the most influential companies in the XR/Metaverse industry. The founding team is visionary, seasoned, and balanced. We have kept the company self-funded and post-revenue since 2017. Our client has recently completed a successful funding round from world-class investors for the expansion of its core technology team. Come join us to make a difference by building a public good and defining the future of the internet.\n\nAbout the Role\n\nIn this position, you will work with a small team of multidisciplinary developers that perform a wide range of tasks. Our client is looking for a person with great problem solving skills and a solid computer science foundation.\n\nYou will mainly interact with our systems, which are GPU servers and cloud services. We have to embrace continuous integration, and need to set up correct automated tests. Our goal is to automate all our DevOps processes to run smoothly unsupervised. Ideally you’re passionate about emerging technologies like AR/VR and own a headset.\n\nKey Responsibilities:\n• Setup backend services;\n• Deploy and support GPU-powered services for the Network;\n• Creating asynchronous APIs.\n\nKey skills:\n• Development experience with Python (3+ years);\n• Creation of asynchronous APIs;\n• Working with SQL;\n• Understanding Docker and have experience with deployment and setup;\n• Good practices of DevOps and CI/CD;\n• Ability to communicate with the engineering team in English.\n\nGood to have skills:\n• Experience with Kubernetes;\n• Experience for deployment GPU-infrastructure on Windows and Linux;\n• Experience with cloud providers services setup (AWS, Google Cloud, MS Azure);\n• noSQL;\n• Aiohttp, Aiortc;\n• Ansible, WinRM.\n\nEducation and Experience\n\nWe are most interested in what you have accomplished and your demonstrated ability to succeed in this role. You may have some or all of the following:\n• A degree in engineering or computer science\n• 3 or more years of experience in a similar position\n• Experience working with local and remote teams, including experience working internationally\n\nCompensation and Benefits\n\nWe offer a competitive salary, stock option plan, extended health benefits (Medical, dental, prescription and more) and a wellness program.\n\nPerks and Work-Life Balance\n\nWe’re establishing our office at the Waterloo Accelerator Centre - a modern and vibrant facility adjacent to the University of Waterloo campus. It’s conveniently located on the Ion electric light rail system running North-South here in Waterloo Region. The Waterloo Accelerator is a modern work environment with plenty of natural light, open space and flexible meeting areas as well as free coffee/tea/beverages.
