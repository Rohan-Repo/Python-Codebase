# CanTek-Python-Week
<h3> Python Assignments for CanTek's Data Analysis Cohort </h3>

In the first week, I Analysed the data for the <b> [DVD Rental DB](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/) </b>

In the second week, I worked on a Data Web Scraping Project, scraping data from the <b> [4DaysWeek Website](https://4dayweek.io/). </b>  
<br />
I also Consumed <b> [SERP's Google Jobs API](https://serpapi.com/google-jobs-api) </b> to Grab Job Descriptions and Analyse and Visualize the Skill Data.
<br /> <br />
