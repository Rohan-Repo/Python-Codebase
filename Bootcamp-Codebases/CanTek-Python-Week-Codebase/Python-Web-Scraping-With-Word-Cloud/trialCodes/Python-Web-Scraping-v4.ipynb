We want to give them the support and autonomy they need to feel well and maintain full lives outside of work.\\n\\n_Payout_\\n\\n- Competitive salary, plus equity in an early-stage startup. Emphasis on “plus”—we won’t use equity to low-ball you.\\n\\n_Healthcare for Full-Time Employees:_\\n\\n- 100% company-funded health, vision, and dental insurance for our employees. That means no monthly premiums coming out of your paycheck.\\n- FSA plans\\n- Free One Medical membership\\n- Free Real membership\\n- $1800 annual mental wellness stipend you can put toward therapy, psychiatry, fitness and other wellness services\\n- Short- and long-term disability coverage\\n- Life insurance\\n\\n_Retirement for Full-Time Employees_\\n\\n- 401(k) — we don’t match yet, but you’ll thank us for the compound interest later.\\n\\n_Vacation_\\n\\n- Unlimited PTO…that we actually encourage you to take, we promise.\\n\\n_Rest_\\n\\n- Four day work weeks Monday-Thursday\\n- Four-week paid sabbatical after five continuous years of work at Real.\\n\\n_Floating Holidays_\\n\\n- Three floating holidays in addition to company-wide federal holidays so you can celebrate what’s important to you.\\n\\n_Grief Break_\\n\\n- Real employees receive two weeks of paid time off in the event of losing a loved one. We know grief doesn’t have an end date, and we also know that “unlimited PTO” isn’t enough for most people to actually take ample time away from work. We want to support the process of grieving by naming this, and offering employees the opportunity to grieve without thinking of work.\\n\\n_Parenthood_\\n\\n- Competitive paid parental leave and flexible return to work policy.\\n\\n_Autonomy_\\n\\n- Flexible working environment — if you want to exercise at three PM, go for it.\\n- Remote-inclusive team — whether you work from Colorado or NYC, you’re 100% part of the team.\\n- Autonomous work culture. We don’t have to see a green dot on Slack to trust that you’re doing your job.\\n\\n_Growth at Work_\\n\\n- We invest in your career. Our company's growing quickly, and we'll give you the opportunity to do the same. You'll have access to a number of professional development opportunities so that you can keep up with the company's evolving needs and grow your career along the way.\\n\\nThe responsibilities and duties of this position described here are representative of those an employee must perform.

Benefits impact how we act, rest, grieve, set boundaries, and take care of ourselves and others — and that means quality benefits are a fundamental part of not just a mentally well company, but a mentally well society. At Real, we want to offer our employees more than just \\\"permission\\\" to occasionally take a vacation or comp a therapy session. We want to give them the support and autonomy they need to feel well and maintain full lives outside of work.\\n\\n_Payout_\\n\\n- Competitive salary, plus equity in an early-stage startup.

We know grief doesn’t have an end date, and we also know that “unlimited PTO” isn’t enough for most people to actually take ample time away from work. We want to support the process of grieving by naming this, and offering employees the opportunity to grieve without thinking of work.\\n\\n_Parenthood_\\n\\n- Competitive paid parental leave and flexible return to work policy.\\n\\n_Autonomy_\\n\\n- Flexible working environment — if you want to exercise at three PM, go for it.\\n- Remote-inclusive team — whether you work from Colorado or NYC, you’re 100% part of the team.\\n- Autonomous work culture. We don’t have to see a green dot on Slack to trust that you’re doing your job.\\n\\n_Growth at Work_\\n\\n- We invest in your career. Our company's growing quickly, and we'll give you the opportunity to do the same.

Benefits impact how we act, rest, grieve, set boundaries, and take care of ourselves and others — and that means quality benefits are a fundamental part of not just a mentally well company, but a mentally well society. At Real, we want to offer our employees more than just \\\"permission\\\" to occasionally take a vacation or comp a therapy session.

We know grief doesn’t have an end date, and we also know that “unlimited PTO” isn’t enough for most people to actually take ample time away from work. We want to support the process of grieving by naming this, and offering employees the opportunity to grieve without thinking of work.\\n\\n_Parenthood_\\n\\n- Competitive paid parental leave and flexible return to work policy.\\n\\n_Autonomy_\\n\\n- Flexible working environment — if you want to exercise at three PM, go for it.\\n- Remote-inclusive team — whether you work from Colorado or NYC, you’re 100% part of the team.\\n- Autonomous work culture.

Benefits impact how we act, rest, grieve, set boundaries, and take care of ourselves and others — and that means quality benefits are a fundamental part of not just a mentally well company, but a mentally well society. At Real, we want to offer our employees more than just \\\"permission\\\" to occasionally take a vacation or comp a therapy session. We want to give them the support and autonomy they need to feel well and maintain full lives outside of work.\\n\\n_Payout_\\n\\n- Competitive salary, plus equity in an early-stage startup. Emphasis on “plus”—we won’t use equity to low-ball you.\\n\\n_Healthcare for Full-Time Employees:_\\n\\n- 100% company-funded health, vision, and dental insurance for our employees.

We know grief doesn’t have an end date, and we also know that “unlimited PTO” isn’t enough for most people to actually take ample time away from work. We want to support the process of grieving by naming this, and offering employees the opportunity to grieve without thinking of work.\\n\\n_Parenthood_\\n\\n- Competitive paid parental leave and flexible return to work policy.\\n\\n_Autonomy_\\n\\n- Flexible working environment — if you want to exercise at three PM, go for it.\\n- Remote-inclusive team — whether you work from Colorado or NYC, you’re 100% part of the team.\\n- Autonomous work culture.

We know grief doesn’t have an end date, and we also know that “unlimited PTO” isn’t enough for most people to actually take ample time away from work. We want to support the process of grieving by naming this, and offering employees the opportunity to grieve without thinking of work.\\\\n\\\\n_Parenthood_\\\\n\\\\n- Competitive paid parental leave and flexible return to work policy.\\\\n\\\\n_Autonomy_\\\\n\\\\n- Flexible working environment — if you want to exercise at three PM, go for it.\\\\n- Remote-inclusive team — whether you work from Colorado or NYC, you’re 100% part of the team.\\\\n- Autonomous work culture.

Benefits impact how we act, rest, grieve, set boundaries, and take care of ourselves and others — and that means quality benefits are a fundamental part of not just a mentally well company, but a mentally well society. At Real, we want to offer our employees more than just \\\\\"permission\\\\\" to occasionally take a vacation or comp a therapy session. We want to give them the support and autonomy they need to feel well and maintain full lives outside of work.\\\\n\\\\n_Payout_\\\\n\\\\n- Competitive salary, plus equity in an early-stage startup.

We know grief doesn’t have an end date, and we also know that “unlimited PTO” isn’t enough for most people to actually take ample time away from work. We want to support the process of grieving by naming this, and offering employees the opportunity to grieve without thinking of work.\\\\n\\\\n_Parenthood_\\\\n\\\\n- Competitive paid parental leave and flexible return to work policy.\\\\n\\\\n_Autonomy_\\\\n\\\\n- Flexible working environment — if you want to exercise at three PM, go for it.\\\\n- Remote-inclusive team — whether you work from Colorado or NYC, you’re 100% part of the team.\\\\n- Autonomous work culture.

We know grief doesn’t have an end date, and we also know that “unlimited PTO” isn’t enough for most people to actually take ample time away from work. We want to support the process of grieving by naming this, and offering employees the opportunity to grieve without thinking of work.\\\\n\\\\n_Parenthood_\\\\n\\\\n- Competitive paid parental leave and flexible return to work policy.\\\\n\\\\n_Autonomy_\\\\n\\\\n- Flexible working environment — if you want to exercise at three PM, go for it.\\\\n- Remote-inclusive team — whether you work from Colorado or NYC, you’re 100% part of the team.\\\\n- Autonomous work culture.

Benefits impact how we act, rest, grieve, set boundaries, and take care of ourselves and others — and that means quality benefits are a fundamental part of not just a mentally well company, but a mentally well society. At Real, we want to offer our employees more than just \"permission\" to occasionally take a vacation or comp a therapy session. We want to give them the support and autonomy they need to feel well and maintain full lives outside of work.\\n\\n_Payout_\\n\\n- Competitive salary, plus equity in an early-stage startup. Emphasis on “plus”—we won’t use equity to low-ball you.\\n\\n_Healthcare for Full-Time Employees:_\\n\\n- 100% company-funded health, vision, and dental insurance for our employees.

We know grief doesn’t have an end date, and we also know that “unlimited PTO” isn’t enough for most people to actually take ample time away from work. We want to support the process of grieving by naming this, and offering employees the opportunity to grieve without thinking of work.\\n\\n_Parenthood_\\n\\n- Competitive paid parental leave and flexible return to work policy.\\n\\n_Autonomy_\\n\\n- Flexible working environment — if you want to exercise at three PM, go for it.\\n- Remote-inclusive team — whether you work from Colorado or NYC, you’re 100% part of the team.\\n- Autonomous work culture.

We know grief doesn’t have an end date, and we also know that “unlimited PTO” isn’t enough for most people to actually take ample time away from work. We want to support the process of grieving by naming this, and offering employees the opportunity to grieve without thinking of work.\\\\n\\\\n_Parenthood_\\\\n\\\\n- Competitive paid parental leave and flexible return to work policy.\\\\n\\\\n_Autonomy_\\\\n\\\\n- Flexible working environment — if you want to exercise at three PM, go for it.\\\\n- Remote-inclusive team — whether you work from Colorado or NYC, you’re 100% part of the team.\\\\n- Autonomous work culture.

Benefits impact how we act, rest, grieve, set boundaries, and take care of ourselves and others — and that means quality benefits are a fundamental part of not just a mentally well company, but a mentally well society. At Real, we want to offer our employees more than just \\\\\"permission\\\\\" to occasionally take a vacation or comp a therapy session. We want to give them the support and autonomy they need to feel well and maintain full lives outside of work.\\\\n\\\\n_Payout_\\\\n\\\\n- Competitive salary, plus equity in an early-stage startup.

We know grief doesn’t have an end date, and we also know that “unlimited PTO” isn’t enough for most people to actually take ample time away from work. We want to support the process of grieving by naming this, and offering employees the opportunity to grieve without thinking of work.\\\\n\\\\n_Parenthood_\\\\n\\\\n- Competitive paid parental leave and flexible return to work policy.\\\\n\\\\n_Autonomy_\\\\n\\\\n- Flexible working environment — if you want to exercise at three PM, go for it.\\\\n- Remote-inclusive team — whether you work from Colorado or NYC, you’re 100% part of the team.\\\\n- Autonomous work culture.
